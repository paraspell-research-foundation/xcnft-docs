# Pallet that communicates with you üó£Ô∏è

Following section goes through xcNFT's errors and events to help you identify what could be causing your problems or whether you message executed successfuly.

## Pallet errors

xcNFT contains error messages, that appear when certain conditions are not met and they should inform you, what went wrong as clearly as possible.

Unclear error message? Feel free to open issue in [following repository](https://github.com/paraspell-research/xcnft-pallet).

Below is a list of errors, where you can find the specific error you are getting along with brief explanation of it:
```js
/// Error returned when collection does not exist.
CollectionDoesNotExist,

/// Error returned when NFT does not exist.
NFTDoesNotExist,

/// Error returned NFT already exist.
NFTExists,

/// Error returned when cross-chain proposal already exists.
ProposalAlreadyExists,

/// Error returned when account is not collection owner.
NotCollectionOwner,

/// Error returned when same NFT is already received.
NFTAlreadyReceived,

/// Error returned when proposal is expired and couldn't be voted on anymore.
ProposalExpired,

/// Error returned when proposal is still active, so cross-chain transfer cannot be
/// initiated.
ProposalStillActive,

/// Error returned when proposal does not exist.
ProposalDoesNotExist,

/// Error returned when proposal did not pass.
ProposalDidNotPass,

/// Error returned when user has already voted the same vote.
AlreadyVotedThis,

/// Error returned when maximum number of owners is reached.
MaxOwnersReached,

/// Error returned when user is not NFT owner.
NotNFTOwner,

/// Error returned when NFT is not received, but user wants to claim it into different
/// collection.

NoNextCollectionId,

/// Error returned when user enters wrong origin collection id.
WrongOriginCollectionAtOrigin,
```

## Pallet events

To notify you of successful or unsuccessful (only in receiving chain) scenarios, xcNFT implements self explanatory events, that help you diagnose state of your cross-chain calls on both origin and destination Parachains.

Unclear or buggy event message? Feel free to open issue in [following repository](https://github.com/paraspell-research/xcnft-pallet).

Below is a list of events along with brief explanation:
